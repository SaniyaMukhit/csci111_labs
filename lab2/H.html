   <p>A settlement existed under Seljuk, the founder of the Seljuk dynasty. The modern city had its beginnings in 1817 as the site of a Kokand fortress known as Ak-Mechet, or white mosque. The later-famous Yaqub Beg was once the fort's commander, but he was apparently not in command during the final battle. In 1853, during the Russian conquest of Turkestan, the fort was taken by Russian troops under General Vasily Perovsky.[3] The Russians established a new fort and called it Fort-Perovsky, after the general. The town of Perovsk in Russian Turkestan later developed around the fort. In 1925, the city was renamed Kzyl-Orda and was designated as the capital of the Kazak ASSR. The name literally means a red city, from the Turkic (red; used here in the common Soviet ideological connotation) and the Turkic Mongolian (city).In 1927 the capital was relocated to the southeastern region and Alma-Ata. "Kyzylorda", the Kazakh-based romanized spelling, has been used since the late 20th century after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Kazakhstan's independence in 1991. Since independence, many of the outhouses were erected in several apartment buildings used as dormitories during Soviet rule due to lack of sewage systems for indoor plumbing. A RFE/RL report in April 2018 stated that the Kazakh Republic government was planning to modernize Soviet era buildings</p>
